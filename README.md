K-Means Clustering Demonstration

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the K-Means clustering algorithm using a synthetic dataset generated with make_blobs.
The notebook visualizes the dataset, applies K-Means clustering, and compares the results with the true labels to illustrate the effectiveness of the clustering technique.
